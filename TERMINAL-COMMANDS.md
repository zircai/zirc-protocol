- `CaKe` = `CAKE`

### 2. Wallet Connection
Many commands require wallet connection:
- `/portfolio` ‚úÖ Requires wallet
- `/balance` ‚úÖ Requires wallet
- `/approvals` ‚úÖ Requires wallet
- `/top` ‚ùå No wallet needed
- `/gas` ‚ùå No wallet needed

### 3. Command History

- Use **‚Üì** (down arrow) to navigate forward

### 4. Quick Clear
Type `/clear` anytime to start fresh with a clean terminal.

### 5. Multiple Queries
The terminal supports up to **50 queries per session** in the current version.

### 6. Natural Language Tips
- Be conversational: "What's the gas price?" works!
