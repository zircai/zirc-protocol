# 🚀 Quick Start: Security Updates

## ⚡ What Just Happened?

Your zIRC protocol just got a **massive security upgrade** - going from basic security to **enterprise-grade protection**, all at **zero cost**.

---

## ✅ What Changed?

### 1. **API Keys Are Now Protected** 🔐
- **Before**: API keys were visible in browser (anyone could steal them)
- **After**: API keys are server-side only (completely hidden from users)

### 2. **Rate Limiting Added** 🚦
- Prevents abuse of your API endpoints
- Limits: 50 requests per minute per IP

### 3. **Input Validation** 🛡️
- All user inputs are now validated
- Prevents injection attacks and malformed data

### 4. **Security Headers** 🔒
- 8 HTTP security headers added
- Protects against XSS, clickjacking, and more

### 5. **Session Security** ⏱️
- Auto-disconnect after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Domain verification (anti-phishing)

### 6. **Transaction Warnings** ⚠️
- Users get warnings before signing dangerous transactions
- Detects scams and suspicious contracts

### 7. **Security Logging** 📊
- All security events are now logged
- Track connections, errors, and suspicious activity

## 🔧 REQUIRED: Update Your Environment Variables

### Step 1: Update `.env.local`

**OLD (Delete this):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BSC_API_KEY=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_id
```

**NEW (Use this instead):**
```bash
# Server-side only (more secure)
BSC_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key_here
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id_here
```

**Action:**
```bash
# Copy the template
cp env.template .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add your API keys
# (without the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
```

### Step 2: Update Vercel Environment Variables

If you're deployed on Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Delete** these old variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BSC_API_KEY` ❌
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` ❌

5. **Add** these new variables:
   - `BSC_API_KEY` = your BSCScan API key ✅
   - `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` = your WalletConnect ID ✅

6. **Redeploy** your application

---

## 🧪 Test It's Working

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Open your browser to http://localhost:3001

# 3. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab

# 4. Connect your wallet and query some data

# 5. Check the Network tab - your API keys should NOT appear! ✅
```

- ✅ Production-ready security out of the box

### For Your Users
- ✅ Protected from phishing attacks
- ✅ Warned before signing dangerous transactions
- ✅ Auto-disconnect prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ Transparent security (see what's protected)

### For Everyone
- ✅ **Zero cost** - No paid services required
- ✅ **Zero maintenance** - Built-in to Next.js
- ✅ **Production ready** - Deploy with confidence

## 🚨 Important Notes

### WalletConnect Project ID
**Note:** The `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` can remain as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` if needed. This is a project identifier (not a secret), so it's safe to expose. However, for consistency, we support both.

### Backward Compatibility
The code supports both old and new environment variable names during migration:
```typescript
// Works with both formats
const key = process.env.BSC_API_KEY || 
            process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BSC_API_KEY ||
            'fallback';
```

But you should migrate to the new format for maximum security.

## 🔍 Verify Security

### 1. Check API Key Protection
```bash
# Open browser DevTools → Network tab
# Make some API calls
# Search for your API key in requests
# Result: Should NOT find it! ✅
```

### 2. Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make 60+ rapid requests to any endpoint
# After 50 requests: Should get "429 Rate limit exceeded" ✅
```

### 3. Test Session Timeout
```bash
# Connect wallet
# Wait 30 minutes without any activity
# Result: Should auto-disconnect ✅
```

### 4. Check Security Logs
```bash
# Open browser Console
# Filter by: [SECURITY]
# Should see structured log entries ✅
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not working"
- ✅ Check you're using `BSC_API_KEY` (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_BSC_API_KEY`)
- ✅ Restart dev server after changing `.env.local`
- ✅ Verify key is valid on BSCScan

### "Rate limit errors"
- ✅ Normal! Limit is 50 requests per minute
- ✅ Wait 1 minute and try again
- ✅ In production, this protects you from abuse

### "Wallet won't connect"
- ✅ Check `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is set
- ✅ Clear browser cache
- ✅ Try different wallet (MetaMask, Trust, etc.)

### "Session keeps disconnecting"
- ✅ This is a security feature! (30 min timeout)
- ✅ Any mouse/keyboard activity resets the timer
- ✅ You'll get a warning 2 minutes before disconnect
